# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption
This is a project in cryptography that involves implementing image encryption using symmetric key encryption technique.It uses Java swing to program its GUI interface. It asks a user to enter a key which it uses for decryption too. After the user enters key he is asked to select image to encrypt it. While decryption user provides the same key and selects the image to decrypt.
